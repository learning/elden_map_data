    "From the Debate Parlor Site of Grace, head out into the courtyard and to the left to reach the rooftops. Continue along the rooftops until the tower past the Glintstone Sorcerer and three Avionette Soldiers. Across from the tower on another rooftop, an item will be visible. Drop down to the rooftop below and jump on top of the spike near the right edge. From the spike, turn left and jump onto the gargoyle (architectural, not an enemy) protruding from a corner of the building. Another jump will bring you to the rooftop with the item, a Smithing Stone [4]. Alternatively, you can reach this item by jumping from the tower onto a roof opposite the Full Moon Crossbow's chest in the tower.From that roof, a long jump will be required to reach the rooftops with the patrolling Marionette Soldier with spears. Sprinting before the jump is required, as a normal jump will not cover the distance. Note that there is a delay before sprinting starts (likely to determine whether the player is trying to roll or sprint).Continue along the rooftops to the left, past the four Marionette Soldiers and jump onto a platform connected to a tower. Inside, two Marionette Soldiers will ambush you from either side. Climb up the ladder to find a chest with the Full Moon Crossbow.": "高塔上开宝箱",
