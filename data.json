Starting in the Royal capital you will need to find the water well to climb into and find the subterranean shunning grounds. There will be a grace known as \"Underground Roadside\".From there you will want to transverse the sewer pipe to get to the other side of the area. Once done there will be an elevator to take you down to a grace which is right before the mini boss version of Mohg. After defeating him you can roll/attack the altar behind the chest and it will move down out of the way revealing a path. Following this path will lead you to the hardest part which is jumping from coffin to coffin to make your way down the area. NOTE it is slightly above the bottom floor so do not jump off even if you will survive. If you miss that coffin, you will have to start from the beggining of the coffin descend all over to obtain the shield.",
